# Fresh Tomatoes project:

This is a project that I did as part of my Udacity course. I use Python 3.6, however the course is in 2.7. You can see if you run the code that it works just fine either way.  The idea is simple, it's a short bit of python code that opens up an HTML website complete with styling. I used my own modifications in it to suit my style. In the class they said to use your favorite movies, these aren't my favorites per se but I do like them. Especially Amelie. The code is freely available on GitHub here, or on my own account. 

# Installation and usage:
The three files required for this program are media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py and enterntainment.py, though to be sure it runs, just download the whole folder.  The file that actually runs the program is the entertainment file, one run produces the html file, and loads it with a nice animation. If you want to change the styling, use the main_page_head variable in fresh_tomatoes. It uses normal CSS along with Bootstrap 3.7. I'm assuming you can also change the script as well, but I would recommend against it unless you know what you're doing. The HTML layout is in the main_page_content variable. The tester.py file I was having an issue getting show_trailer to work. Feel free to use that if you have any issues with working with the code. I always have one on hand just in case. 

## Issues: 
I have noticed that if you use Windows 10 like I do, that if you forget to name your file specifically with a .py extension part of the program will still run. However part will not, and a partially functioning code is not good at all.  The second function in the Movie class in particular cannot be found by anything else if media is not named .py. So before running double check to make sure media has the .py extension on Windows. You can see that it has the correct extension here, but 

## License:
As far as I am aware there is no prohabition against anyone using this code, though I'd contact Udacity to find out first. Feel free to use my styling in any case.
